## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Load the haven package
library(haven)

# Read the .dta file from GitHub
data <- read_dta("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JenniferLB/Open_data/master/bsa2017_open_enviropol.dta")

# View the first few rows
head(data)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
